# How to plan an experiment: 

If you are supposed to run an experiment, always ask (yourself) the following questions: 

<ul> ●	How many participants do we need? </ul>
<ul> ●	How long does the experiment take? (If you are not sure, do a test run and maybe ask a second person to do it) </ul>
<ul> ●	Is there a deadline? </ul>
<ul> ●	Can we grant VP-Stunden? If yes, who needs to sign them and when will they be in the Lab (so students can find them)? </ul>
<ul> ●	Do I have enough hours to run the whole experiment or do I need to ask another Hiwi to help? </ul>

When you can answer all these questions you can start to set up the experiment/ invitation. 

You should start with scheduling the time slots via Doodle or SONA. For the first day of running the experiment it's always helpful if the researcher is with you in case there is a problem with the code. So make sure to schedule (the first day at least) accordingly. 

When creating the time slots make sure to leave a little break between two appointments, especially if the time participants require to do the experiment varies a bit. 
When you have scheduled your time slots, check the Lab Calendar if the Lab you are using is free and block the Lab for the periods you are using it. If you find that the Lab is occupied, change your schedule accordingly. Of course, you can check the Lab before you schedule the time slots – but only block it when you are really using it. 

# How to create a study via Doodle 
 
Go to your dashboard and select “Create”.
   
Select 1:1 Meeting or Group Poll

Now you can fill in the sections as you need it. For example, like that: 
 

If you use the Group Poll option be sure to limit how many participants can select a time and hide the participant list (this will only be possible with a premium account): 
 
When you have scheduled the time slots and created a study in Doodle you can send the Rundmail to invite participants. 
Important: Check with your researcher if there are any exclusion or inclusion criteria that need to be listed in the Rundmail.  
Important: It takes approximately 1-3 business days for the Rundmail to be sent so take that into consideration when scheduling an experiment. This means that you need to send the Rundmail a few days before you scheduled the first slot so participants have time to sign up for the experiment. However, it´s inadvisable to send the Rundmail too early since there tend to be more cancellations when you plan too long in advance. 

# How to fill in the Rundmail application 
For “Art des Rundschreibens” you usually set “Probanden- und Teilnehmersuche“.
As “Zielgruppe“ you usually set “stud/alle” since you want to address all students. 
For “Termin” you set the date you want the Rundmail to be sent at the latest.

Vielen Dank und liebe Grüße,
your name and name of the researcher 

*All the information you have to change is written in red or marked in yellow.*

# Running the experiment 
When you have sent the Rundmail and participants have signed up, it's time to think about the instructions and the first day of testing. 

<b> Instructions </b>

Talk to the researcher what participants need to know about the experiment. It's helpful to do the experiment (or the start at least) yourself to know about the process and catch any questions that might arise beforehand.  
You can either use a written instruction or do it orally. Whatever you choose, make sure the participants understand the assignment. 

<b> The day before the experiment </b>

Remind all the participants who signed up for the study a day before their session to reduce cancellation to a minimum. 

<b> Testing day </b>

When you start collecting data you always need the following things on hand: 
<u> ●	The data privacy statement for participants to sign before the experiment starts  
[antrag_Fleming_29072021_pbn_lab_v5.0 (1).docx](https://github.com/Fleming-Lab-Wiki/Hiwi-/files/14524892/antrag_Fleming_29072021_pbn_lab_v5.0.1.docx) </u>

<u> ●	A list for participants to sign that they have received payment for their participation </u>
<u> ●	Enough money to pay all participants for the day (ask your researcher) </u>
<u> ●	Other materials needed for testing (i.e. test for colour blindness if necessary) </u>

Now you are good to go! 

# Scheduling an experiment via SONA
In SONA you can schedule a study similar to Doodle. The difference is that you don't need to send a Rundmail since participants can sign up via SONA. However it is possible to copy a direct link to your study on SONA and include it in a Rundmail if you are not sure that you will get enough participants via SONA. 
You find your additional study information if you select the study you have created on SONA. 
/ 
To include the Link to your study in a Rundmail go to "additional study information" and copy the link. 
You find your additional study information if you select the study you have created on SONA.

 # How to get a researcher account 
To schedule participants and grant VP hours you need a researcher account. To get one contact Sandra Dorsch, since she is the SONA admin for the Fleming Lab. You can look up the administrators for the other departments/labs via this link: https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb06/psychologie/studium/sona/sona-admins. 
For the Fleming Lab, Sandra can appoint you a researcher account. You will get an email with your new login information. Note that you can have a student account and a researcher account at the same time. Your login information will be different. 
Sometimes the invitation does not get sent the first time. If you did not get an email, tell Sandra and ask her kindly to send it again. So please take into consideration that this might take a while to set up and plan the experiment accordingly. 

# How to create a study
This is how the welcome page looks once you are logged in. 
Select “Create a new study” under “Add New Study”. 

![image](https://github.com/Fleming-Lab-Wiki/Hiwi-/assets/162586445/ddf858ca-f5a1-409a-97dd-c7cfd3aa3632)





Now you can select a study type according to your needs. Usually you will use a Standard Study. You can select Paid or Credit as payment. 
In case you want to offer both options and let participants choose whether they want credit or payment the SONA researcher guide suggests that you “select credit and note in the study description that payment is an option, too. For participants who get payment, the researcher grants them 0 credits (so the participation is noted correctly) and marks in the comments that they were paid instead (so it’s clear to everyone).”
Then press “continue”. 



➡


Now you can specify details concerning your study. 
Although a description is optional it is helpful to include a short description for participants to decide whether they want to participate or not. 
For researchers you can add yourself and the researcher you are running the experiment for. Include other Hiwis if you expect them to help you with data collection so they can grant credit as well and see who signed up for the experiment. 
Select “Active study” as “yes” if you want your study to be visible to students so they can sign up. You can mark the study as “inactive”   if you want to grant VP-Stunden but did not create the study via SONA. If you are happy with your set up, press “Add this study”. 
 

It is possible to add even more details to your study. For example you can exclude participants who have participated in a similar experiment (if you have scheduled the experiment via SONA as well) or only consider participants who have already participated in a previous experiment. 
Additionally, you can set a deadline for sign up or cancellation. However, if you do that, consider how much time participants will have to sign up. 
You can request to be informed about cancellation and sign ups. Please note that all researchers listed in that study will get an email so make sure to discuss it first with other researchers. 
You can add these extras via Advanced settings (you find those just below the “Add This Study” Button). 
________________________________________

Study approval 
If you have created a study successfully your study needs to be approved before it is visible for potential participants.
Turn to your respective administrator to get your study approved. The build-in function of SONA does not suffice. Write an email with the name of the study to your administrator to get it approved. As described in page 9, Sandra Dorsch is the SONA admin for the Fleming Lab. Please email her for study approval. (You can find other SONA administrators here.) 

How to grant VP-Credit 
If you have created the study and recruited all participants via SONA you can grant credit as follows: 
Go to your study and select “View and administer time slots” in the study menu. Select “all time slots” so you can find the concerning slot. To grant credit, press “Modify”.
 







Now you can select Credit as granted. If you paid the participant with money, select 0 credit and note that in the comments (e.g. paid XX euro). 
 

In case you did not schedule participants via SONA you can still grant credit. You have to create a study and mark it “inactive” so nobody can sign up (note that it still has to be granted). Then you will need the ID Code of the participant you want to grant VP-Credit to. It usually is a 4 digit number. Ask participants what their ID is. Now select a time slot and press “Modify”. You can now sign up participants manually: 
 
Type in the ID code and assign credit as usual. 

You have the option of “Batch Credit Grant” if you want to assign credit to several participants as well. 
Just type in the list of ID Codes of all participants you want to assign credit to in the “Participant List” and press the confirm button. Note that the number of participants has to match the number of slots available (per time slot) when using batch credit grant. You can change the number by selecting a different number of participants when creating a time slot. So if you have selected 4 participants for one time slot you can only assign credit to 4 (or less) participants.
